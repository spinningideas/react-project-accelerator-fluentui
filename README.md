React Project Accelerator Fluent was conceived to aid starting React JS projects and provide a reference implementation for bootstrapping projects.

The project was itself bootstrapped from [create react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and uses [fluent ui](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui/#/controls/web) and grid from [Office Fabric Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/layout) for its UX.

The project aims to include most of the basic things one needs and includes localization and authorization via services based approach using hooks to manage state.
